# Music and Math PKU experiment project
 Markov Random Process
 Now support HMM or large status space to create music, polyphonic/multi-tracks, auto concord, auto duration split and alignment. functions are mainly based on markov process theory and stochastic decision. 
 All writen in Python.
 Requirement: Python3,Numpy,mido
 Hope to achieve more intelligent chord coordination in the future
